This error occurs when you try to access a component's state or props before it has mounted.  In React Native, this often happens when you're attempting to perform actions within a component's constructor or before the componentDidMount lifecycle method is called.

```javascript
// Buggy Code
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: this.props.someData // Error: this.props might be undefined
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
